## NN Gradient descent Polynomial Fit
All results from our polyinomial fitting using gradient descent can be reproduced by running 
results_gradientdescent.py. 

## Neural Network Polynomial Fit
All results from our polyinomial fitting using neural network can be reproduced by running 
results_NN_polyfit.py. 

## Second_NN
The code in the "second_NN" directory has not been used for any of the results in the report.
